Thanks for downloading this game, the source code is compose of 4 python files :
  --> pacman.py : where you launch the game
  --> map.py, functions.py, classes.py : these files are needed for the game to work ! DO NOT TOUCH THEM !

  if you want to play : launch it from the directory "pacman" using the command "python3 pacman.py"
  And then you just have to follow the instructions that appear on the screen

  /!\ Make sure your computer is not sensitive to the cases /!\

  Play and have fun ! ;)
